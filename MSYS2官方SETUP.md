# MSYS2 #

Software Distribution and Building Platform for Windows

MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software.

It consists of a command line terminal called mintty, bash, version control systems like git and subversion, tools like tar and awk and even build systems like autotools, all based on a modified version of Cygwin. Despite some of these central parts being based on Cygwin, the main focus of MSYS2 is to provide a build environment for native Windows software and the Cygwin-using parts are kept at a minimum. MSYS2 provides up-to-date native builds for GCC, mingw-w64, CPython, CMake, Meson, OpenSSL, FFmpeg, Rust, Ruby, just to name a few.

To provide easy installation of packages and a way to keep them updated it features a package management system called Pacman, which should be familiar to Arch Linux users. It brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward and reproducible package building. Our package repository contains more than 2000 pre-built packages ready to install.

For more details see 'What is MSYS2?' which also compares MSYS2 to other software distributions and development environments like Cygwin, WSL, Chocolatey, Scoop, ... and 'Who Is Using MSYS2?' to see which projects are using MSYS2 and what for.

## Installation ##

1.Download the installer: [msys2-x86_64-20210725.exe](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2021-07-25/msys2-x86_64-20210725.exe)

Verify with SHA256 checksum `7e055b71306e64192e2612f959f54ae99a5cf57186206ac702d113ef00ba35c0` or[ GPG signature](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2021-07-25/msys2-x86_64-20210725.exe.sig) by [0xf7a49b0ec](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x0ebf782c5d53f7e5fb02a66746bd761f7a49b0ec&fingerprint=on&op=vindex).

2.Run the installer. MSYS2 requires 64 bit Windows 7 or newer.

3.Enter your desired Installation Folder (short ASCII-only path on a NTFS volume, no accents, no spaces, no symlinks, no subst or network drives, no FAT).

5.Update the package database and base packages. Unless your setup file is very recent, it will take two steps. First run pacman -Syu:

```
$ pacman -Syu

6.Run "MSYS2 MSYS" from Start menu. Update the rest of the base packages with pacman -Su:

```
$ pacman -Su
:: Starting core system upgrade...

7.Now MSYS2 is ready for you. You will probably want to install some tools and the mingw-w64 GCC to start compiling:

```
$ pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

8.To start building using the mingw-w64 GCC, close this window and run "MSYS MinGW 64-bit" from Start menu. Now you can call make or gcc to build software for Windows.

9.Check out the introduction page to learn which Start menu item to use when and which packages to install. Take look at Detailed MSYS2 install guide for troubleshooting and additional details on how to keep your MSYS2 up-to-date.
